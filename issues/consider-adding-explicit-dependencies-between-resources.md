# Consider adding explicit dependencies between resources

While Pulumi will automatically determine some dependencies, it's a good practice to explicitly define dependencies between resources, especially for service enablement which other resources depend on.

infrastructure/project.py

```diff
-Service("enable-run", project=PROJECT, service="run.googleapis.com")
-Service("enable-eventarc", project=PROJECT, service="eventarc.googleapis.com")
-Service("enable-secretmanager", project=PROJECT, service="secretmanager.googleapis.com")
-Service("enable-pubsub", project=PROJECT, service="pubsub.googleapis.com")
+run_api = Service("enable-run", project=PROJECT, service="run.googleapis.com")
+eventarc_api = Service("enable-eventarc", project=PROJECT, service="eventarc.googleapis.com")
+secretmanager_api = Service("enable-secretmanager", project=PROJECT, service="secretmanager.googleapis.com")
+pubsub_api = Service("enable-pubsub", project=PROJECT, service="pubsub.googleapis.com")
```

Then you can reference these as dependencies for other resources:

```python
service_account = Account(
    "platform-service-acct",
    account_id="platform",
    display_name="Cloud Run Price Model Service Account",
    opts=pulumi.ResourceOptions(depends_on=[run_api, pubsub_api])
)
```

# Service account created with appropriate naming

The service account creation is properly implemented with a descriptive display name. For further improvement, consider adding a description field to provide context about the account's purpose and usage.

```diff
service_account = Account(
    "platform-service-acct",
    account_id="platform",
    display_name="Cloud Run Price Model Service Account",
+   description="Service account for the Haskell platform running in Cloud Run with Pub/Sub subscription capabilities",
)
```

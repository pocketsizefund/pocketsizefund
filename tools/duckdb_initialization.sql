-- DuckDB initialization script
--
-- Loaded automatically by the start-duckdb devenv script. Creates read-only
-- views over the S3 data lake so production and export data is queryable
-- immediately.
--
-- Two prefixes, one owner each, and they are not interchangeable:
--
--   data/    the trainer's own archive. Fetched from Massive and written by the
--            trainer VM, which has no database. This is the training input and
--            the long-term record of equity bars and ticker metadata; it
--            accumulates for as long as the bucket keeps it.
--   exports/ the application's nightly export of the tables only it knows
--            about -- events, predictions, pairs, account state -- plus the
--            journal, which is the original those tables are derived from.
--            This is what the retention window would otherwise discard.
--
-- Bars and ticker metadata appear under data/ and nowhere else. They used to be
-- exported as well, from the same Massive endpoint by a second path, and two
-- writers of one fact is one too many.
--
-- The two prefixes live in two buckets, which is why there are two variables
-- below. data/ is shared and the same for every instance; exports/ is this
-- instance's own record and differs per profile.
--
-- Requirements:
--   - AWS credentials configured in the environment (e.g. ~/.aws/credentials)
--   - AWS_S3_ARCHIVE_BUCKET_NAME set (start-duckdb passes the bucket argument)
--   - AWS_S3_RECORDS_BUCKET_NAME set (start-duckdb takes it from the profile)

-- Scoped to one cadence rather than globbing the whole bar tree. The archive is partitioned on
-- interval, so an unscoped glob would union daily and intraday bars into one view and every query
-- against it would silently double-count. hive_partitioning still surfaces interval as a column,
-- which is what makes the scoping visible in a result rather than only here.

-- Every stock split Massive reports, historical and announced, refreshed whole each night. Named

-- rather than a partition per date: the feed revises and cancels announced splits, so a row that
-- disappears is a cancellation and the current table is the only authoritative answer.
--
-- split_from shares become split_to shares -- a two-for-one forward split is 1 -> 2 and a

-- prints an IO error and is skipped; every other view still loads, and this one appears after the

-- query over it, so this is where to go when the tables disagree with each other.
--
-- The envelope is columns and the body is a JSON string, so filter on event_type and reach into

--
--   SELECT payload->>'ticker', payload->>'outcome'

-- prices it read, the orders it sent, the fills they produced. Joining on it is how a duration
-- becomes an answer about where the time went.
--
-- schema_version is 3 through 6; v1 and v2 were development and their objects are gone. Four
-- payload fields have changed shape, so a query reaching into any of them must branch on the
-- version:
--
--   open_pair_reading.stop_at, through v5, was written beside entry_z_score. It is derivable from
--   it and is now absent; a query wanting the stop line on any version should compute it from
--   entry_z_score rather than read the field, which is the same number on every past record.
--
--   quote_rejection, at v4, was the bare reason string 'stale_quote' or 'wide_quote'. It is now an
--   object whose 'reason' key holds that same string alongside the reading that produced it --
--   age_seconds and limit_seconds for a stale quote, relative_spread and limit for a wide one.
--   Under v3 the reading is simply gone; there is nothing to recover it from.
--
--   early_closes[].session_close, at v4, was 'HH:MM' and is now 'HH:MM:SS'.
--
--   The structural-break detail, at v5, spelled its first key 'log_return' and now spells it
--   'logarithmic_return'. The format is otherwise unchanged, so a query wanting both versions can
--   match either spelling; the value and the limit beside it mean exactly what they did.
--
-- Fields are added within a version as well as across one, and an absent key reads as NULL either
-- way, so "the build predated this field" and "there was nothing to record" are the same answer.
-- Anything counting a field should bound the query by the first session that has it rather than
-- treating an early NULL as a zero.

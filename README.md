## Project

### Setup

Run the commands below in your terminal to get started. We're always a work in progress so if something breaks or is confusing open a pull request to raise it with the team and get your hands dirty.

We're never done and that's a good thing.

```sh
curl https://mise.run | sh
mise install -y
mise tasks ls
```

### Principles

An unordered and non-exhaustive list of principles we work towards:

> Test in production  
> Always roll forward  
> Systems over process  
> No code is good code  
> Never write documentation  
> Git is truth  
> Communicate with issues and pull requests

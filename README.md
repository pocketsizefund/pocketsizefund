## Project

### Motto

> Make money and learn things 💡  

Accountability for these goals is enforced by:  

1. **Publishing performance** on a regular, automated basis  
2. **Writing whitepapers** for every significant initiative  

### Process

Our process is:

```
create -> launch
   ^         |
   |         v
learn  <-  measure
```

We want to rapidly iterate our research-first mindset by constantly launching with an MVP implementations for every initiative.  

### Principles

An unordered and non-exhaustive list of principles we work towards:

> Test in production  
> Always roll forward  
> Systems over process  
> No code is good code  
> Never write documentation  
> Git is truth

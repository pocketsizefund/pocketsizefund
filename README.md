## About

**Pocket Size Fund** is an open source quantitative trading firm being built on nights and weekends.  

This repository holds the main resources for the fund platform including data pipelines, model definitions, trading engine, and frontend resources.  

The project is actively a work-in-progress.  

## Project

### Motto

> Make money and learn things 💡

Accountability for these goals is enforced by:

1. **Publishing performance** on a regular, automated basis
2. **Writing whitepapers** for every significant initiative

### Process

Our process is:

```
create -> launch
   ^         |
   |         v
learn  <-  measure
```

We want to rapidly iterate our research-first mindset by constantly launching with an MVP implementations for every initiative.

### Setup

Run the commands below in your terminal to get started. We're always a work in progress so if something breaks or is confusing open a pull request to raise it with the team and get your hands dirty.

We're never done and that's a good thing.

```sh
curl https://mise.run | sh
mise install -y
mise tasks ls
```

### Principles

An unordered and non-exhaustive list of principles we work towards:

> Test in production  
> Always roll forward  
> Systems over process  
> No code is good code  
> Never write documentation  
> Git is truth  
> We only measure ROI

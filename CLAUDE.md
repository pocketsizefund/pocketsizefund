## GitHub Issue Creation

When asked to create a new GitHub issue:

1. Follow the structure in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Include:
   - A descriptive title with [FEATURE|BUG] prefix
   - Add the "backlog" label
   - Explain why the feature is needed
   - Detail the benefits it will bring
   - Propose two implementation options (after considering at least five)
   - For each option, include:
     - Files that need updating
     - Code diff of proposed changes
     - Cost-benefit analysis

## GitHub Issue Workflow

1. After creating a ticket, it will be reviewed and possibly modified
2. Issues labeled as "ready" are prepared for implementation
3. When asked to look at ready tickets, search for GitHub issues with the "ready" label
